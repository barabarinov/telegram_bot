## Calculation of expenses and incomes
## I have tried many similar applications but they all are uncomfortable to use, so I created my own. You can create yours own categories of incomes and expenses. And  than to add names and costs of income/expense to these categories. Also you can put on display the current amount of expenses/incomes separately for each category and the total current amount of expenses/ incomes of all categories, by one command. Every 1st day of a new month, the bot sends a general report of expenses/incomes.
